			<h1>In summary, </h1>
			

			<ul>
				<p>
				<li> Since 2019, I am a postdoc working at the lab of Prof. Horacio Rotstein at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. </li>
				<br>
				<li> I obtained my PhD from the University of São Paulo. There, I worked with Prof. Antonio Carlos Roque in Computational Neuroscience since I was an undergraduate.
					I was part of the lab <a href="http://sisne.org/?lang=en"><i>SisNe</i></a>. During this time I was able to work in many projects on Computational Neuroscience.</li>
				<br>
				<li> I was also part of the <a href="https://neuromat.numec.prp.usp.br/"><i>NeuroMat</i></a> group from the University of São Paulo. There, I was able to interact with Mathematicians
					and we developed some brain models involving stochastic processes.</li>
				<br>
				<li> In 2015, as a PhD candidate, I was awarded funding from the São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) to spend a year at the Humboldt
					University in Berlin. At that time I worked with Prof. Benjamin Lindner and Prof. Michael Zaks. Check <a href="../publications">Publications</a> to see some of the papers we published. </li>
				<br>
				<li> During my PhD I was part of the <a href="https://www.physik.hu-berlin.de/de/irtg1740">International Research Training Group (IRTG) 1740</a>. Because of that, I traveled
					many times to Berlin and learned a lot by interacting with researchers at the Humboldt University and at the Potsdam University. In particular, I learned a lot of Dynamical System's and Information theoryat this time. </li>
				<br>
				<li> In 2012, as an undergraduate, I was awarded a scholarship to study one year abroad and I chose to go to the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland where I could learn much 
					more about Neuroscience and Computational Neuroscience. Furthermore, at the time I worked with graph theory under the supervision of Prof. Christian Gaumier at EPFL. </li>
				<br>
				<li> Throughout my career, I have also interacted with many labs that focus works on electrophysiological recordings. I have already proposed models to explain those data as well as how to extract information from these data. 
					Specifically, the paper "<a href="https://doi.org/10.1142/S0129065720500227"><i>Modeling hippocampal CA1 GABAergic synapses of audiogenic rats</i></a>" 
					published at the International Journal of Neural Systems was in the media in many important national newspapers including 
					<a href="https://www.uol.com.br/vivabem/noticias/redacao/2020/04/19/propriedades-de-neuronios-e-testa-tratamentos-para-epilepsia-no-computador.htm">UOL VivaBem</a> which is a Brazilian web newspaper content and the fifth most visited website in Brazil (data from 2012). </li>
