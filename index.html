					<p>Welcome to my website! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University, where I specialize in Computational and Theoretical Neuroscience. My research interests center around understanding the fundamental aspects of neuronal behavior and how they relate to network phenomena.

In my current projects, I focus on modeling different levels of brain organization, ranging from ion channels and neuronal cells to networks and reduced mean-field/firing-rate models. I also employ various techniques to gain insight into how these levels of organization interact.

Throughout my career, I have developed expertise in a variety of fields, including Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Information Theory, Stochastic Processes, and Dynamical Systems. Thank you for taking the time to visit my website!
