					<p>Thanks for visiting my website! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. 
					   I work with Computational and Theoretical Neuroscience. My research interest stems from my desire to understand the 
					   fundamental aspects of neuronal behavior and how they connect to network phenomena.
					   My projects involve modeling different levels of brain organization: ion channels, neuronal cells, networks, and reduced mean-field/firing-rate models. 
					   I also apply techniques that help me understand how these levels of organization interact. 
					   Throughout my career, I have been involved with Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Information Theory, Stochastic Processes, and Dynamical Systems.
