					<p>Thanks for visiting my website! I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the New Jersey Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. 
					   I work with Computational and Theoretical Neuroscience. My research interest stems from my desire to understand the 
					   fundamental aspects of neuronal behavior and how they connect to network phenomena.
