				<li> <p>I've helped to put together the group <a href="https://neurocompbr.org/" target="_blank">neuro-comp-br</a>. This is a Brazilian group focused on sharing information about Computational Neuroscience 
					(opportunities, seminars, curiosities, etc) and has more than 160 members from students to PIs.

				<li> <p>Together with Horacio Rotstein, we are proposing a workshop on "Frequency-preference responses to external perturbations: from neurons to networks" at the
