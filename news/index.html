				<li> <p> On May 20 and 21, 2022, I will be presenting a poster at the 17th Annual Conference on <a href="https://sites.google.com/njit.edu/facm2022/home" target="_blank"></a>Frontiers in Applied and Computational Mathematics (FACM'22).</a> 
				</p>
			</ul>	
			<ul>
				<li> <p> Our paper "Oscillations and variability in neuronal systems: the role of autonomous transient dynamics in the presence of fast deterministic fluctuations" was accepted for publication
					in the Journal of Computational Neurscience, cheers!!!
				</p>
			</ul>	
			<ul>
				<li> <p> I just got the news that our paper "The voltage and spiking responses of subthreshold resonant neurons to structured and fluctuating inputs: resonance, loss of resonance and variability" was accepted for publication
					in Biological Cybernetics!!!
				</p>
			</ul>	
			<ul>
				<li> <p>Check my poster at SFN ''Resonance-based flexible selection of cognitive tasks and memory suppression in a hippocampus - prefrontal cortex network regulated by the nucleus reuniens''.
				</p>
			</ul>		
			<ul>
				<li> <p>I will be presenting two posters at the <a href="https://www.cnsorg.org/cns-2021" target="_blank">CNS*2021.</a> Look for posters P178 and P73.
				</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li> <p>Together with Horacio Rotstein, we are organizing a workshop on "Frequency-preference responses to external perturbations: from neurons to networks" at the 
					 <a href="https://www.bernstein-network.de/en/bernstein-conference/2021-online/satellite-workshops/frequency-preference-responses-to-external-perturbations-from-neurons-to-networks" target="_blank">Bernstein Conference 2021</a> (check the schedule).
				</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li> <p>I am helping to organize a Journal Club on <a href="https://web.njit.edu/~pena/CompNeurOsc_JournalClub.html" target="_blank">Neuronal Oscillations: modeling, computations & analysis</a>
				</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li> <p>I was invited to present at 2021 SIAM Conference on Dynamical Systems (May) at the Minisymposia <a href="https://meetings.siam.org/sess/dsp_programsess.cfm?SESSIONCODE=71311" target="_blank">"Stochastic Oscillators"</a>
				</p>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li> <p>I've helped to put together the group <a href="https://neurocompbr.org/" target="_blank">neuro-comp-br</a>. This is a Brazilian group focused on sharing information about Computational Neuroscience 
					(opportunities, seminars, curiosities, etc) and has more than 160 members from students to PIs.
